1. Reason for using BLL projects and well libraries  to bind  in tree view?

We are doing this because we have loaded all the related data from the file into the memory, Now we are just using 
that in-memory data

2. How entites work in the application

All entities are of type ExtendedBindingList which will raise the event upon adding, removing and changing any element in the 
collection.

Reason for making the design in this way because there could be several ways a object make entry into the collection
like undo-ing and redo-ing could make the impact in the application, so there must be a single entry point for all where we 
could do the basic things that we need to do to make it work

Whenever an object added to the collection, we initializing undo-redo operation, if that addition is because of some chain reaction 
like adding  a project which further has several wells in it then we used to check an object name UndoRedoLiveObject

Only actual entity that initialize the  effect has the authority of creating the live object rest will just be added to its
Multiple collection which actually is a queue to know the sequence of element being added or removed
